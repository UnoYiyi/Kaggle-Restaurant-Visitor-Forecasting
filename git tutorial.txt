git checkout -b yiqing (create your own branch)
git checkout master (go back to master branch)
git checkout yiqing (go to your own branch)
git push -u origin yiqing (push change in this way instead of directly git push) 


# If your local repository mess up and you wish to overwrite with git pull
git checkout master
git fetch –-all (downloads the latest from remote without merge)
git reset –-hard origin/master OR git reset –-hard origin/<branch_name> (resets the branch with that you just downloaded)
